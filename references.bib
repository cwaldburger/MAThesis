    abstract = {Signature recognition is a relevant area in secure applications referred to as biometric identification. The image of the signature to be recognized (in off-line systems) can be considered as a spatio-temporal signal due to the shapely geometric and sequential character of the pencil drawing. The recognition and classification methods known to us are based on the extraction of geometric parameters and their classification by either a linear or nonlinear classifier. This procedure neglects the temporal information of the signature. In order to alleviate this, this paper proposes to use signature parameters with spatio-temporal information and its classification by a classifier capable of dealing with spatio-temporal problems as hidden Markov models ({HMM}). The proposed parameters are calculated in two stages; first, the preprocessing stage which includes noise reduction and outline detection through a skeletonization or thinning algorithm; and second, a parameterization stage in which the signature is encoded following the signature line and recording the length and direction of the pencil drawing obtaining a vector that includes the signature spatio-temporal information. The classification of the above parameters is done by a {HMM} classifier working in the same way as isolated word recognition systems. To design (train and test) the {HMM} classifier we have built a database of 24 signatures of 60 different writers},

Images of valid and casually forged signatures are collected and binarized, using an electronic digitizing camera. Performance of this approach with a small number of valid signatures in the training set is examined, and substantial improvement is demonstrated when forgeries are included in the set. In particular, the equal-error rate for the SDF classifier with forgeries included is shown to average $\sim$4\% across nine different subjects. The effects of image preprocessing on false acceptance and true rejection rates are examined. The use of alternatives to forged signatures in the training matrix is explored. Finally, SDF performance is shown to deteriorate when the tested forgeries are produced with some a priori knowledge of the target signature.},

    abstract = {{False acceptance or rejection rates by automatic verification systems for handwritten signatures of the order of 5\% have been reported previously by the author. When setting with completely different signatures (randomly matched), the false acceptance rate was still approximately 1\%, which is not acceptable for signature shapes which are so obviously different. A method is described which can greatly reduce the incidence of such errors. It is based on elastic matching of the shape of the sample signature with one or more samples of the reference. This has been achieved by line-thinning, line-thickening (defocusing) and correlation techniques using a variable sized window with pan and scroll techniques, a VAX 8600, and a De-Anza image processing unit. It was assumed that the reference and sample were oriented roughly in the same direction. Measurements were made using the identical database of signatures as previously. Preliminary results indicate that the error rate in accepting random signatures can be improved by a factor of 20 while the false rejection rate is increased by only 2\%. The acceptance rate for forgeries is also appreciably reduced.}},

    abstract = {{This paper proposes a method (SDP method) of off-line signature verification incorporating a sequential application of the dynamic programming matching method in its preprocessing stage. Based on the frequencies of black pixels in each signature projected on the x-axis, the SDP method determines an optimum segmentation of any signature into the same number of components as the representative reference signature. The SDP method measures the dissimilarity between the suspect signature and the representative signature, and accept the suspect signature as genuine without any further scrutiny, if the dissimilarity is below a threshold. When the suspect signature is not accepted, the SDP method subsequently applies a verification procedure proposed by Yoshimura and Yoshimura(1997) to it. This paper evaluates also the effectiveness of the SDP method through an experiment using a database of 800 Japanese signatures, half of which were obtained on the area of countersignature on sheets similar to a traveler's check, whereas the remaining were on the area of authentic signature. The experiment used the countersignatures as suspect signatures to obtain estimates of mis-verification rate, taking five signatures alternatively from the twenty authentic signatures as the reference signatures. It achieved values as low as 12.9\% in an average mis-verification rate.}},
